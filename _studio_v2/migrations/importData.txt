--replace
Overwrite existing documents. If you specify _id in the imported data, this flag can be very useful. It will let you reimport stuff that you got wrong in an earlier pass.

--missing
Only create documents which don't exist, leave the rest alone.

run:
% sanity dataset import migrations/transput.ndjson production --replace
